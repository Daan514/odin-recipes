    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>who doesnt love a big, tender, juicy steakhouse burger?
     Problem is, theyre difficult to replicate at home because
    most steakhouses blend different cuts of beef like sirloin, 
    chuck, and short ribs
    to customize the flavor and fat content of their burgers.
    Its certainly possible to grind your own meat or ask your 
    butcher for a special blend, but its not always practical.
    Fortunately, theres an easier way. By combining ordinary
    supermarket ground beef with a panade or mixture of bread
    and milk and lots of seasoning, you can make steakhouse-style burgers in no time.
